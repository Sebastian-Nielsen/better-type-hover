# The problem

The ts_ls (typescript lsp) `vim.lsp.buf.hover()` is in many cases completely useless:

This plugin improves `vim.lsp.buf.hover()` by actually showing the exact declaration of the `interface` or `type` (crazy how that's not the default ðŸ¤”). 

Additionally, you can press the sign on the line to open a popup with the declaration of the "nested type":

# Installation

Lazy.nvim
```lua
{
  "Sebastian-Nielsen/better-type-hover",
  config = function()
    
  end,
}
```

# Todo:

- [x] Configure how to treat large interface declarations: Fold some lines or maybe show it all but make the popup scrollable
- [ ] Handle that a nested type is e.g. `style?: StyleHTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> & CSSProperties;`. Currently, it only expands the left-most (`StyleHTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>` in this case)
- [x] reindent declaration in case it is indented
