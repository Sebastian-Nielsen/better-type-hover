This plugin is still work in progress. Currently, the mapping to trigger this "better-type-hover" is hardcoded to `<C-P>`. I would love some feedback.

# The problem

The ts_ls (typescript lsp) `vim.lsp.buf.hover()` is in many cases completely useless:

This plugin improves `vim.lsp.buf.hover()` by actually showing the exact declaration of the `interface` or `type` (crazy how that's not the default ðŸ¤”). 

# Installation

Currently, there is no config options to pass to setup. 

Lazy.nvim
```lua
{
  "Sebastian-Nielsen/better-type-hover",
  config = function()
    require("better-type-hover").setup()
  end,
}
```

# Todo:

- [ ] Configure how to treat large interface declarations: Fold some lines or maybe show it all but make the popup scrollable
